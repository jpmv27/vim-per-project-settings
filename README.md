Vim plugin to manage per-project settings outside the source tree of the projects.

Still in development, expect non-backward compatible changes at any time.

Intended to be used with [vim-project](https://github.com/jpmv27/vim-project) but
can also be used with `autocmd` from `.vimrc`.

Browse the source for more information, docs to come later.
